AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The new, action could not be found for the :find_test
callback on QuestionsController, but it is listed in the controller's

like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.
